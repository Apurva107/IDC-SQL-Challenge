🧠 Day 4 – LIMIT(FETCH) and OFFSET
LIMIT, OFFSET, and Pagination Concepts

📘 Topics Covered
Topics: LIMIT, OFFSET, pagination concepts

The LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned in a result set.
OFFSET is used to skip a specific number of rows before starting to return results.
Together, they help in implementing pagination — breaking large results into smaller, manageable chunks.

📚 Reading & Resources
LIMIT restricts the number of rows returned. OFFSET skips a specified number of rows before returning results.

Basic Syntax:
To limit the output to specific no of rows.

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows;
To skip a specific number of rows before returning results

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET skip_rows;
Key Points:

LIMIT controls how many rows are displayed. OFFSET determines where the display should begin.

Pagination Example:

Page 1 → LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0

Page 2 → LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10

Page 3 → LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20

Useful for large datasets where showing all records at once isn’t practical.
