🧠 Day 5 – Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
Aggregate Functions in SQL

📘 Topics Covered
Topics: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX functions

Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single summarized result.
They are especially useful for analyzing numerical data, generating reports, and deriving insights such as totals, averages, or extreme values.

📚 Reading & Resources
Aggregate functions work on groups of rows (or entire tables) and are often used with the GROUP BY clause to compute results for each group.
For example, you can calculate the total number of patients per service or the average satisfaction score across departments.

Basic Syntax:
-- COUNT(): Counts the number of rows
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- SUM(): Adds up all values in a column
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- AVG(): Calculates the average value
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- MIN(): Finds the smallest value
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- MAX(): Finds the largest value
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Key Points:
Aggregate functions ignore NULL values (except COUNT(*) which counts all rows).

They can be combined with GROUP BY for category-based summaries.

Often used with HAVING to filter aggregated results.

Useful in data reporting and analysis (e.g., total patients, highest cost, average satisfaction).
