🧠 Day 3 – Sorting Data with ORDER BY
📘 Topics Covered
Topics: ORDER BY, ASC/DESC, multiple column sorting

The ORDER BY clause allows you to sort query results based on one or more columns.
Sorting helps you organize your data in a meaningful order — such as highest score, alphabetical order, or chronological order.

Basic Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];
Key Points:
ASC → Ascending order (default) – A → Z, 0 → 9, oldest → newest

DESC → Descending order – Z → A, 9 → 0, newest → oldest

You can sort by multiple columns (e.g., first by department, then by age)

NULL values usually appear first with ASC and last with DESC
