🧠 Day 6 – GROUP BY Clause
GROUP BY Clause and Aggregating by Categories

📘 Topics Covered
Topics: GROUP BY, aggregating by categories

The GROUP BY clause divides rows into groups based on column values, allowing you to apply aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) to each group individually.
It is a powerful way to summarize and categorize data in SQL.

📚 Reading & Resources
Basic Syntax:
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
Key Rules:
Every non-aggregated column in the SELECT clause must appear in the GROUP BY clause.

Each group produces one result row.

Use aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) on other columns.

You can group by multiple columns for detailed segmentation.

💡 Tips & Tricks
✅ Think “one row per group” — if you GROUP BY service, you’ll get one row per service. 
✅ Execution order in SQL: FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT 
✅ Use WHERE before GROUP BY to filter rows.
✅ Use HAVING after GROUP BY to filter aggregated results. 
✅ Grouping multiple columns increases granularity for deeper insights.
